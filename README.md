Weather

Description: A simple weather app using the OpenWeather API, my third project. 
Built with Vanilla JS due to the need to practice working with HTTP requests and data parsing. 

This was the first time that I made it a point to focus on the design and responsiveness. It was also a useful way for me to practice concepts 
that I was learning in a JavaScript course. 

Future plans include refactoring the code to use async/await, and possibly implementing new features. 

How to use: Type in the name of the desired city. Make sure it's spelled correctly. In case of cities which have the same name, please provide 
the country code to get the desired result.
